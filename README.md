# Rust-bio, a rusty bioinformatics library.

This library provides implementations of many algorithms and data structures
that are useful for bioinformatics.
All provided implementations are rigorously tested via continuous
integration (https://travis-ci.org/johanneskoester/rust-bio).

Currently, rust-bio provides

* pattern matching,
* pairwise alignment,
* suffix arrays,
* BWT and FM-Index,
* rank/select data structures.
